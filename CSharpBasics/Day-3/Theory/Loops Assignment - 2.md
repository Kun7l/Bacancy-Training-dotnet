# Loops Assignment - 2

1. **Infinite Loops**

Infinite Loop is a loop that never terminates its execution and runs endlessly. There are two ways to do that. 

1. using while loop :

while(true){

// body of loop

} 

this will run infinite times.

ii.   Using For loop:

for(;;){

//body of loop

}

this for loop wil also run infitine times.

1. **Break vs Continue**
    
    **Break** : 
    
    Immediately exits the loop completely. Once break is executed, the loop stops and control goes outside the loop.
    
    **Continue** :
    
    Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one. The loop does not stop, only that iteration is skipped
